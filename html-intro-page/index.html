    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>
        Hi my name is Ashley Aguilar. This is my first HTML page!
    </p>
    <h2>About me...</h2>
    <p>
        I am majoring in computer science and hope to one day become a software engineer.
        When I'm not in school, I enjoy: going on hikes, playing the guitar &lpar;in a 
        very amateur way&rpar;, discovering new cafes, and SLEEPING.
    </p> 
    <h2>Three things I'd like to learn:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Italian</li>
        <li>How to play the piano</li>
        <li>How to create a website...obviously ;&rpar;</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Attachments...</h2>
